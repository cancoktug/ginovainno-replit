Hi [Buyer Name],

Thank you for clarifying! I understand now - you need me to deploy the application directly on your server.

I'm happy to handle the complete deployment for you. Since your team has already imported the database, I'll deploy the source code, configure everything, and get your website live.

🔑 TO PROCEED, I'LL NEED THE FOLLOWING ACCESS:

1. SERVER SSH ACCESS:
   - Server IP address: _______________
   - SSH username: _______________
   - SSH password or private key: _______________
   - SSH port (usually 22): _______________

2. SERVER INFORMATION:
   - Operating System (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 8): _______________
   - Control panel if any (CWP/cPanel/Plesk or None): _______________
   - Root or sudo access: Yes / No

3. DOMAIN & DATABASE:
   - Domain name where site should be live: _______________
   - Database host: _______________ (usually localhost)
   - Database name: _______________
   - Database username: _______________
   - Database password: _______________
   - Database port: _______________ (usually 5432 for PostgreSQL)

4. ADDITIONAL (Optional):
   - SendGrid API key for email notifications (if you have one)
   - SSL certificate preferences (I can set up free Let's Encrypt)

⏱️ DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE:

Once I receive the credentials:
- Setup & deployment: 1-2 hours
- Testing & verification: 30 minutes
- Your website will be LIVE with HTTPS ✅

📋 WHAT I'LL DO:

✅ Install Node.js 20 (if not installed)
✅ Install PM2 process manager
✅ Install & configure Nginx
✅ Deploy source code from Replit
✅ Configure environment variables
✅ Connect to your imported database
✅ Set up SSL certificate (HTTPS)
✅ Configure firewall
✅ Launch application on your domain
✅ Verify everything works correctly

🔒 SECURITY NOTE:

For security, you can:
- Provide temporary SSH access (I'll confirm when done)
- Change passwords after deployment
- Or have your team observe during deployment

📞 COMMUNICATION:

I'll keep you updated throughout the process:
- When I start deployment
- Any issues encountered
- When site goes live
- Final verification steps

Please send me the credentials above, and I'll start deployment immediately.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration on future projects!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
